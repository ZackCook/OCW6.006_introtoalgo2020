3. **Conway’s Game of Life**: Implement Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton, where you simulate the evolution of a grid of cells based on simple rules. This project involves recursion and can be extended to include optimizations and visualizations.
Conway’s Game of Life:

Description: Implement Conway's Game of Life in a graphical application. Allow users to create initial configurations and observe how the cells evolve over time based on Conway's rules.
Key Concepts:
Data Structures: Use 2D arrays to represent the grid.
Algorithms: Implement the rules of the game, which involve checking the state of neighboring cells.
Optimization: Explore techniques to optimize the simulation for larger grids.
Visualization: Create an engaging visual representation of the grid, allowing users to interact with it by adding or removing cells.
Steps to Implement Conway’s Game of Life:
Initialize the Grid:

Create a 2D array to represent the grid.
Allow the user to set the initial configuration of live cells.
Implement the Rules:

For each cell, determine the number of live neighbors.
Apply Conway's rules to update the grid for the next generation:
Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
Optimize the Simulation:

Use techniques like sparse matrices or only updating regions that change to handle larger grids efficiently.
Create a User Interface:

Develop a graphical interface to display the grid.
Allow users to start, pause, and reset the simulation.
Provide options for users to draw the initial configuration and modify it during the simulation.
Enhance the Visuals:

Add animations to make the simulation visually appealing.
Use colors to distinguish between different states of cells (e.g., newly born, surviving, and dying cells).
Learning Outcomes:
Practice implementing algorithms and data structures.
Gain experience with recursive functions and dynamic programming.
Enhance your skills in optimizing and visualizing algorithms.
Create an engaging and interactive application that demonstrates the concepts learned.

2. **Network Packet Router**: Build a network packet router simulation that uses algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson to manage data flow through a network.

### Group 7: String Algorithms and Computational Geometry
