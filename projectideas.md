2. **Network Packet Router**: Build a network packet router simulation that uses algorithms like Ford-Fulkerson to manage data flow through a network.

### Group 7: String Algorithms and Computational Geometry
**Lectures**:
1. Lecture 22: String Matching: Naive, Rabin-Karp
2. Lecture 23: String Matching: KMP
3. Lecture 24: Computational Geometry

**Project Ideas**:

2. **Convex Hull Finder**: Implement a convex hull algorithm that takes a set of points and finds the smallest convex polygon that encloses all the points.

### Group 8: Algorithmic Paradigms and Miscellaneous
**Lectures**:
1. Lecture 25: Linear Programming
